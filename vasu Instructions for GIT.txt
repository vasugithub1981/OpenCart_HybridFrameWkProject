GITHUB
------

after login into github..
create new repository by clicking + beside profile (top right corner)
normally we give project name for the repository
after setup we get link :
https://github.com/vasugithub1981/OpenCart_HybridFrameWkProject.git

---------------------------------

git remote add origin "https://github.com/vasugithub1981/OpenCart_HybridFrameWkProject.git" 

git push -u origin master

(master is the default branch code)
******** in real time team lead will create own branch name we push in to our own branch name instead of "MASTER"
(-u - will not ask username and pwd pushes directly to master)
(The above commands will push data from local repository to GITHUB (REmote repository))

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2nd round if any changes made in code
------------------------------------
git status - it will show in red what changes have done
git add -A 
git commit -m "This is my 2nd commit"
git push origin master

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IF you want to get file from GITHUB to work place

Select location and create a file in github by clicking new file and save as "XXX.java"
and write some sample code - after that bottom there is option - "COMMIT NEW FILE" click

to get the file from GITUB to Work place i.e ecllipse

git pull - this command will pull the details to ecllipse


----------------------------------------------------------------------

clone

if we need to get entire project from GITHUB to work place "ECLLIPSE" we use "CLONE"
--no need of all the above commands
git clone "<git hub repository URL>" <FOlder name> 

which folder in local system we need project
It will dump the entire project into the folder

got to Ecclipse ->File -> import -> existing projects in to workplace -> next -> browse that file...
